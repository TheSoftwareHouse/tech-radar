    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in
          to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage
          culture in our Zalando production environment, low risk and
          recommended to be widely used.
        </td>
        <td>
          <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work
          with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious
          usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations.
          TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our
          organization walked this path and will share knowledge and
          experiences.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and
          have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest
          some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact.
          ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and
          highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that
          have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find
          teams that have started a prototyping effort.
        </td>
        <td>
          <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used
          for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to
          (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new
          projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.
